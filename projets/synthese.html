    <p>Dans le cadre de mes études à EPSI, un module de langue étrangère (Anglais) proposait à chacun d'étudier un sujet. Une problématique a dond été posée et le sujet étudié à l'aide de divers moyen : vidéos, articles de presse, articles web.</p><br>

      <img src="../images/robot.jpg" class="w-50 p-3 m-auto" alt="">
      <p>A humorist (Blanche Gardin) was talking about technological advances. And she was saying that we created the planes to satisfy a dream, a desire. We fly by plane, at least we say "fly" but in reality it is the plane that flies.
        We believe in satisfying our desires and our dreams thanks to the technologies. Similarly with our laptops, we think we have gotten smarter with it, but is that true ? We have become more dependent. A Caveman knew how to make his tool.
        Ask us to make a flint, no one will know how to make it. That is why future IT engineers need to think about new technologies that can make us less dependent. I wanted to compare these two intelligences and to think about the super
        intelligence we are creating, because one day this "super intelligence" may surpass Human Intelligence. </p>

      <ul>
        <li><u>Definition of Intelligence and a particular one : Artificial Intelligence</u><br>
          <br><p>Intelligence, as a global definition, can be defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.
            But what artificial intelligence really means ? Artificial Intelligence is the development of computer systems in such a way as to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. This innovation, created by human intelligence,
            allows to do specific tasks much faster with less effort, which is apparently the ultimate objective.
            We can finally say that by developing Artificial Intelligence we are searching to simulate a Human Intelligence.

        </li>
        <br><li><u>Two types of Artificial Intelligence</u><br>
        <br><p>There are two types of artificial intelligence : weak and strong.</p>

          <div class="media-body align-self-center">
            Weak Artificial Intelligence represent an AI system that is designed and trained for a par-ticular task such as Virtual personal assistants (Apple's Siri for example).

        <div class="media">
          <div class="media-body align-self-center">
            Strong Artificial Intelligence – also known as artificial general intelligence – refers to an AI system with generalized human cognitive abilities. A strong AI system is able to find a solution without human intervention.

          <div class="d-flex flex-column">
            <br><p>Artificial Intelligence is used in several domains such as the healthcare, education, business.
            Artificial Intelligence has many different uses : visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. Artificial is incorporated into a variety of different types of technology such
            as robotics, self-driving cars, machine vision – facial recognition, cameras are now abled to recognize us.
            This graph recaps the domains in which AI is used.</p><br>

    <div class="card-body">
      <ul>
        <li><u>An intelligence created by Humans, for Humans and just like Humans</u><br>
          <br><p>As we said earlier, AI is the simulation of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence was created for humans, to make it easier for us to work.<br>
            Humans are doted of a natural intelligence. This intelligence is defined as the quality of the mind that is made up of capabilities to learn from past experience, adaptation to new situations,
            handling of abstract ideas and the ability to change our own environment using our knowledge. Human Intelligence can provide several kinds of information.</p>
        </li>
        <li><u>An imperfect copy of Human Intelligence</u><br>
          <br><p>We know it Artificial intelligence and human intelligence develop around cognitive functions such as memory, problem-solving, learning, planning, language, reasoning, and perception.<br>
            There is just one big difference between human and artificial intelligence : human intelligence is better at multi-tasking and it can incorporate emotional elements, human interaction.
            As humans we have a sensitive cognition. Human intelligence can provide data on things about which the subject has specific knowledge, in the case of defectors and spies, sensitive information to which they had access.
            Finally, it can provide information on interpersonal relationships and networks of interest.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="border-bottom" id="reseau">III/ A future with both Human & Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <div class="card-body">

            <div class="media-body align-self-center">
              After thinking how amazing is artificial intelligence, we have to think about security. Accord-ing to me, the danger comes not only from the machines, it also comes from the use we make of it.
              Hackers (hackers use machine learning tools to gain access to sensitive systems) or deepfakes (people fabricates videos of public figures saying or doing things that never took place) are perfect examples.
              Then, we have to think about the regulation for AI uses. For example, Europe's GDPR puts strict limits on how enterprises can use consumer data.<br>
              There is an article with an amazing title which is “Stop Thinking AI vs. Human, Think AI With Human”. I think this is quite a good solution. In fact, we always want to compare, to oppose all things.
              But in this case this is really dangerous. We have to find a solution to cohabitate with and not to be exceeded or surpassed by AI.<br>

        </li><br>
        <li><u>Can we build AI without losing control over it ?</u><br>
          <div class="media d-flex flex-column">
            <div class="media-body align-self-center">
              <br><p>This is THE question we have to think about. There is a video in which Sam Harris describes a quite terrifying scenario on how the advances we make on the AI could end up destroying us. As he says,
              the most disturbing is that we are still unable to get an idea of the dangers that await us.<br>
              We can't reverse it. It is too late : we can only improve our technologies. A move back would be so complicated : no more Internet, no more networks, no more automation, no more technology.
              We are now obliged to improve our technology. And one day, we will build a machine smarter than we are. And these machines will improve themselves.<br>
              There is a mathematical process called "the explosion of intelligence". In fact, we only have a perception of global intelligence and we cannot predict the curve of intelligence.
              We just know that the machines we create are much smarter than we are because they "think" faster than we do. And this is what the "explosion of intelligence" is.</p>

We just know that the machines we create are much smarter than we are because they "think" faster than we do. And this is what the "explosion of intelligence" is.
              <br>As Sam Harris points out, which as you can see has inspired me a lot, we are far, human, to be at the top of intelligence. Let's not forget that electronics go a million times faster than we do. A machine created by man thinks a million times faster. How to stop or limit such a device?
              <br>The machines, conscious or not, will destroy us, as the same we exterminate the ants by crushing them without any scruple.
              <br>On the other hand, if we had a super AI that knows how to do everything by itself, a perfect AI, what would we become? Without any more work, nothing to do, but even more inequality of wealth, and an unemployment rate never seen.</p>
